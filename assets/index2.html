                    <h1>Teaching the important part of Ports and Adapters</h1>
                    <p>Experientially, I've found that the popular explanations of ports and adapters are not very good
                        at actually explaining Ports and Adapters<sup>[0][1][2]</sup>. If you send the usual batch of
                        articles to newer devs, chances are high that they'll come back either confused, missing the
                        point, or, most commonly, drawing the <i>wrong</i> lesson entirely (like thinking the important
                        part is the naming). In short, we need to teach it better. This is my approach to explaining the
                        architecture.</p>
                    <p>From a pedagogy stand point, the problem seems to be that explanations get so bogged down in the
                        details that the main idea never gets to bubble to the surface. Not to mention, for whatever
                        reason, articles on the topic tend to suffer from enterprise buzzword soup which further bogs
                        things down. Read the original ports and adapters article<sup>[0]</sup> and tell me you don't
                        get semantic satiation of the word "port" by the end. Port. Port. Port. Other popular
                        descriptions floating around the internet aren't much better with their usage of things like
                        "transport layers", "Interactors", and other obfuscations<sup>[1]</sup>. If you dip into the
                        shamelessly re-branded "clean architecture" version of all this, you'll be greeted with an
                        entire 300+ page book of lingo from your friendly neighborhood Uncle Bob<sup>[4]</sup>. Throw
                        any of those at someone for the first time, and they'll walk away with the view that Ports and
                        Adapters is some crazy complex over engineered architecture. </p>
                    <p>So when explaining it, you've gotta ignore all the details and cut down to the absolute core of
                        what the architecture is about, which is one very basic thing:</p>
                    <p><strong>Write your code so that you can add new ways of interacting with the world later
                            <i>without</i> having to modify anything you've already written.</strong></p>
                    <p>That's it. That's the whole explanation. When teaching it, the trick is to <i>not</i> mention
                        "Ports" or "Hexagons", or other shapes, and instead just explain the <i>quality that we want our
                            architecture to provide.</i> Good architecture gives us the freedom to attach new ways of
                        communicating with the outside world without requiring us to modify any existing code in order
                        to do so. That's what we're after.</p>
                    <p>Then you pair it with a small challenge / heuristic: pick two wildly different ways of
                        interacting with the world, say, an HTTP API and a local CLI, and then ask how they would have
                        to structure their code so that it could be used to power both of these external connections to
                        the world. Magically, all the other buzz word stuff tends to fall into place without ever being
                        explicitly defined or explained, because there's really only one <i>obvious</i> way to do it: by
                        decoupling the core of the program from the external world, giving it some standardized
                        interface (aka: a <i>port</i>)<sup>[5]</sup> over which new pieces can talk, and then building
                        some <i>adapters</i> for schlepping data in/out of that interface. They'll still of course
                        fumble around a bit with the exact boundaries, but this tends to get the soul of the
                        architecture internalized.</p>
                    <p>Once the core idea is shoved into their heads, then you can hit them with the "by the way, this
                        approach is usually called {pick your branding flavor here}", and which point they'll have the
                        tools to actually parse through the extraneous details.</p>

                            sense. Stop writing so many useless one-off interfaces, people! Interfaces are for
                            <i>abstractions</i>, not <i>concretions!</i> </li>
